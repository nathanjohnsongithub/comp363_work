The penalty for the alignment $X_{m-1}$ and $Y_{n-1}$ is then $P'= P-\\alpha_{x_m y_n}$. That's the penalty of the optimal alignment minus the score associated with the match (or mismatch) of $x_m$ and $y_n$ in the last column.\n",

If we add the column $\\left|\\begin{array}{c}x_m\\\\ y_n\\end{array}\\right|$ to this *hypothetical* optimal alignment, the total penalty for the new alignment of $X_m$ and $Y_n$ becomes $P^* + a_{x_m y_n}$.\n",

If $P'$ does not correspond to the optimal alignment of $X_{m-1}$ and $Y$, there must be another optimal alignment for these strings with penanlty $P^*<P'=P-\\alpha_\\text{gap}$. Adding the last column $\\left|\\begin{array}{c}x_m\\\\ \\text{gap}\\end{array}\\right|$ to $P^*$ we get: $P^*+\\alpha_\\text{gap}< P$, i.e., there is an alignment for strings $X$ and $Y$ whose penalty is less than that of their optimal alignment, which is a contradiction. Therefore, the rest of the alignment of $X$ and $Y$ when we remove its last column $\\left|\\begin{array}{c}x_m\\\\ \\text{gap}\\end{array}\\right|$ is an optimal alignment for $X_{m-1}$ and $Y$."
