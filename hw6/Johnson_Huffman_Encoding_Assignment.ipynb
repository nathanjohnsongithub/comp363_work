        "Given the following code, develop a small app to compress and decompress a message using Huffman Encoding. Also, compute the actual effiiency of the compression. Ideally, you'll need at two principal methods:\n",
        "\n",
        "* `compress(message)` and\n",
        "* `decompress(message, encoding_tree)`\n",

        "\n",
        "If you are not familiar with [Python type hints](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html), it means that method `compress` takes a string as an argument and returns a tuple comprising a string, Huffman_Node, and a real number. The returned string is the compressed message and the returned Huffman Node is the root of the encoding tree. The real number is the compression ratio.\n",
        "\n",
        "The key and the value in the dictionary are both strings. A typical entry in that dictionary would look like:\n",
        "\n",
        "The compression ratio is the size of the compressed message divided by the size of the message if it were left in ASCII code. The size, in ASCII code is always `8*len(message)` because there are 8 bits per ASCII character.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, here're the Huffman and ASCII encodings of `HELLO WORLD`:\n",

        "\n",
        "Consider the earlier example with `HELLO WORLD`. The Huffman encoding is 35 bits long, which is 40% of the ASCII encoding. That seems like a good compression. Until we realize that in addition to those 35 bits we also have to transmit the encoding table -- so whoever receives the compressed message can decompress it.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Huffman encoding table for `HELLO WORLD` requires about storage for its keys (`H`, `E`, `L`, `O`, `' ' `, `W`, `R`, `D`) and its values. There are 8 keys, all ASCII symbols, requiring 8 bits each. The Huffman codes (`1100` for `H`, `1101` for `E`, etc) each require one byte as well. That's a total of 16 bytes or 128 bits. The actual efficiency is\n",

        "\n",
        "$$ r_\\text{a} = \\frac{35+128}{88} = 1.85 $$\n",
        "\n",
        "Realistically, the ratio is even higher, taking into consideration additional storage required to manage the data structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "Modify your ``decompress`` method to return not only the decompressed message but also the actul efficiency of the compression. For $t$ assume 16 bits for each node in the Huffman tree.\n",
        "\n",
        "Also, can you imagine/propose a way to ensure $r_\\text{a} < 1 $ even for very small values of $m$?\n",
